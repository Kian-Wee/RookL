# Changes from Original Rook

![](https://imgur.com/7ST39oV.png)

Added holes to reduce weight and material, not yet tested as parts have yet to arrive. Will be making more changes to make it lighter.

Modified bottom frame to add mounting plate for printer controller(SKR2,  Mini E3 v3, SKR Pico compatiable) and a full size raspberry pi. For the power supply, I am planning on using an [external brick](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32859196804.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.1.47484a7awWEszN&algo_pvid=4d0083df-cb2e-405d-a98b-878e44d97db2&aem_p4p_detail=20221117145354560531062640660001320020&algo_exp_id=4d0083df-cb2e-405d-a98b-878e44d97db2-0&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22sku_id%22%3A%2212000022808964725%22%7D&pdp_npi=2%40dis%21SGD%219.31%216.05%21%21%21%21%21%40211bf48d16687256341687230d075e%2112000022808964725%21sea&curPageLogUid=s4zzdsA7DHOD&ad_pvid=20221117145354560531062640660001320020_1&ad_pvid=20221117145354560531062640660001320020_1) to power it.

Moved holes in top gantry mount to allow for the screws to clamp onto the linear rods directly. This is to allow for squaring of the frame to avoid skew if the rods are recycled and of unequal length.
